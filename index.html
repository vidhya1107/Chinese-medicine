<h1>Chinese Medicine</h1>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) originated in ancient China and has evolved over thousands of years. 
TCM practitioners use herbal medicines and various mind and body practices, such as acupuncture and tai chi, 
to treat or prevent health problems. In the United States, people use TCM primarily as a complementary health approach.</p>
